UPDATES

READ REPORT FOR MORE DETAILS

__________________________
Changes(07.03)
Fix Lab 4.1 - Gaussian works
Lab 3.1 - did a loop for shadow detection but there is an error


Changes (06.03):
Lab1.0 - added support of RGB
Lab1.1.1.2 - added support of RGB
Lab3.1 - shadow

Need to be done:
Lab1.1.3 - add support for RGB (in progressiveupdate function)
Lab3.1 - shadow detection based on hsv (code the conditions)

Lab1.0 Generation of foreground segmentation mask

for each video frame using “frame difference”  - done only gray

Lab1.1.2: Progressive update of background model through
selective running average (blind and selective update) - done only for gray

Lab1.1.3: Suppression of stationary objects that appear or
are removed - done only for gray

Lab 4.1: Implementation of advanced background
subtraction algorithms - done, but there is an error (or thresholdvalue should be different)
